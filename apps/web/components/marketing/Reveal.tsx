 * Hand-rolled rather than pulled from `motion`: that library is a dependency
 * but is not otherwise on this page, and the marketing bundle is kept
 * deliberately small for ad traffic arriving in mobile in-app browsers. An
 * observer costs nothing and reuses the pattern the sticky CTA bar already
 * used.
 *
 * The animation itself lives in `marketing.css` behind
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`, so a visitor who asked for less
 * motion simply sees the content. The `<noscript>` override in the layout
 * covers the case where JavaScript never arrives.
